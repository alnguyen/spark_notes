# 1. Build Radically Candid Relationships
----

#### It's called management, and it's your job
- Emotional labor is not just part of the job; it's the key to being a good boss

#### How to be a good boss
- Bosses guide a team to achieve results
- Guidance
  - Often called "feedback"
- Team-building
  - Figuring out the right people for the right roles
    - hiring
    - firing
    - promoting
- Results

#### Relationships, not power, drive you forward
- Establish a trusting relationship with each person who reports **directly** to you
- Three responsibilities as a manager:
  - Creating a culture of guidance (praise and criticism)
  - Understanding what motivates each person on your team
  - To deliver results collaboratively

#### Radical candor
- Two dimensions
  - "Care personally"
    - Truly giving a damn about people
  - "Challenge directly"
    - Telling people when their work isn't good enough
    - And when it is

#### Care personally: The first dimension of radical candor
- Your humanity is an attribute, not a liability to being effective
- People fail to "care personally" at the injunction of "keep it professional"
  - Employees are still human; treat them as such
- "Bring your whole self to work"
  - Care about the whole person with your whole self
- Being a boss is a *job*, not a value judgement

#### Challenge directly: The second dimension of radical candor
- Challenge others and encourage others to challenge you
  - Shows you care enough to point out both the things that aren't going well and those that are
  - Shows you are willing to admit when you're wrong and that you're committed to fixing the mistakes that you or others have made
- Accept that sometimes people on your team will be mad at you
- Always offer to help fix the problem
- Must be able to criticize somebody's work or role

#### What radical candor is not
- Importance of humility
- Don't nitpick *everything*
- Not hierarchical
  - Need to practice it upward, downward, sideways

#### Radical candor is universally human, but interpersonally and culturally relative
