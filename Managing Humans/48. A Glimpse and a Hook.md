# 48. A Glimpse and a Hook
----
- Design your resume to be a consumable glimpse

### The First Pass
- First name.
- Company names.
- Job description and history.
- Other interests and extracurriculars.
- Parts that weren't looked at:
  - Professional objective
  - Skills
  - Summary of qualifications

### The Second Pass
- In-depth job history.
- School.

### Differentiate, Don't Annoy
- Your resume needs to withstand some formatting abuse.
- Never include a cover letter.
- Embrace honest buzzword-compliance.
- If you claim "strong Java background", you'll be pressed on how strong your skills actually are.
- Sound like a human.
- Include seemingly irrelevant experience.

### A Glimpse and a Hook
- A resume is not a statement of facts. It's a declaration of intent.
