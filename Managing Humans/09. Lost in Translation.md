### Your Instincts are 100 Percent Wrong

- When you know where they want to be, you can start to figure out how to get them there.
- Unhappily adrift people want immediate action.
- Your first job isn't understanding core motivation, it's basic communication.
- When personalities are disconnected, you don't know how to communicate.
- Sometimes, when a verbal commitment is made, it's not enough.
  - Go back and forth on clarification until there is understanding of what is necessary to be done.
