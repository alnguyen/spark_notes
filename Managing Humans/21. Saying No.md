# 21. Saying No
----
- The single most powerful arrow in your professional quiver.

### Managers Lose It
- There are managers who are drunk with power.
- It's a learned trait.
- When your boss puts you in a position that involves the most work and least chance of succeeding, say "No".

### Losing It
- Management is a myth.
- We operate under the assumption that they are the ones who can make decisions.
- Managers lose it when they are no longer questioned in their decisions.
- The good managers are ones who have learned how to recover from their decisions with dignity, but more importantly, with help from the team.
- Not being told "no" by your employees can reinforce your thoughts that your ideas are the best, when they may in fact, not be best at all.

### Recovering It
- Saying "no" is saying "stop"
- The ability to strategically choose when it's time to stop is the sign of a manager willing to defy convention.

### Never Trust a Pixie
- Remember, as a manager, you're one big bad decision away from being replaced.
- Embrace the confidence of being "the boss" but stay humble.
- "With great power comes great responsibility."
- The best way to make great decisions is to involve as much of the team as possible in every decision.
- Your team is collectively smarter than you.
- More importantly, by including them in the decision process, you're creating trust by giving them an opportunity to say no.
- A team that trusts you is going to look out for you.
