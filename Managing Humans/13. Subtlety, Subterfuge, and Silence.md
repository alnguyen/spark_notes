# 13. Subtlety, Subterfuge, and Silence
----
- Three leadership approaches for traversing complexity and making progress.
- Part of management is navigating your way through some tricky political jungles.
- It's about getting folks to comfortably bend in an uncomfortable direction.
- A good manager is a person who is playing to a strategy and isn't merely stumbling around squashing fires all day.

### Subtlety
- The point of a performance review is not the review itself but the conversation that stems from it.
- Subtlety starts with humility.
- Sometimes exhibiting your power and knowledge isn't the best method of communicating.
- Subtlety finishes with elegance.
- eg. When performance review isn't getting ideas across, try mapping the areas of work to day-to-day activities.

### Subterfuge
- Subterfuge means "intrigue, deviousness, deceit, deception, dishonesty, cheating, duplicity, guile, cunning, craftiness, chicanery, pretense, fraud, fraudulence."
- Relative to management, it doesn't mean "deceit, dishonesty, cheating, fraud, or fraudulence."
  - It's everything else.
- Subterfuge is a risk.
- The use of subterfuge for good means keeping the intent honest.

### Silence
- In silence, you can assess.

### Business Isn't War
- If you're only interested in building power, you're going to lose.
