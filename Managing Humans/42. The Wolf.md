# 42. The Wolf
----
- The single most productive engineer you'll meet.
- You've heard of the 10x engineer, but let's talk about the Wolf.
- They exhibit the following characteristics:
  - Appear to exist outside of the well-defined process used to get things done.
    - Also appear to not suffer any consequences for not following these rules.
  - Everyone knows they're the Wolf, but no one ever calls them the Wolf.
  - They have a manager, but no one really knows who it is.
  - Have a lot of meetings, but none are scheduled.
    - Inviting them to your meeting is a crap shoot.
  - They understand how "the system" works, how to use it to their advantage, and why it exists.
    - But they think "the system" is a joke.
  - You can ask a Wolf to become a manager, but they'll resist.
    - They'll do a fine job but won't stay in that role for long.
    - Likely to quit when you least expect it.
  - Generates disproporationate value for the company with their unparalleled ability to identify and rapidly work on projects essential to the future of the company.
- Is able to move fast because they are able to avoid the encumbering necessities of a group of people building at scale.
- This level of productivity allows the Wolf to further skirt documentation, meetings, and annual reviews.
- The influence earned by the Wolf can never be granted by a manager.
