# 03 The Ripple Effect

## Collaboration and the Dynamics of Giving and Taking Credit

- Geniuses vs Genius makers
  - Geniuses tend to be takers: to promote their own interests, they "drain intelligence, energy, and capability" from others.
  - Genius makers tend to be givers: they use their "intelligence to amplify the smarts and capabilities" of other people.

### Collaboration and Creative Character

- Studies show that more creative professionals stood out as more "demanding, aggressive, and self-centered"
- Takers have a knack for generating creative ideas and championing them in the face of opposition
  - Because they have supreme confidence in their own opinions, they feel free of the shackles of social approval that construct the imaginations of many people.
- The research on creative architects suggests that takers often have the confidence to generate original ideas that buck traditions and fight uphill battles to champion those ideas
- It is still possible to be highly creative and a giver

### Flying Solo

- Our success depends more on others than we realize
- Carrying knowledge isn't actually so easy.

### I wish I could hate you

- In western culture, we tend to privilege the lone genius
  - Americans see independence as a symbol of strength, viewing interdependence as a weakness
  - Takers tend to see themselves as superior to and separate from others
- Givers are more likely to see interdependence as a strength, a way to harness the skills of multiple people for a greater good
- A defining feature of how givers collaborate: they take on the tasks that are in the group's best interest, not necessarily their own personal interests
- Studies show that on average, the more giving group members do, the higher quantity and quality of their groups' products and services
- _Expedition behavior_ - Involves putting the group's goals and mission first, and showing the same amount of concern for others as they do for themselves
- When givers put a group's interests ahead of their own, they signal that their primary goal is to benefit the group
  - Takers won't feel like they need to compete with the giver
  - Matchers will feel like they owe the givers
  - Givers see other givers as one of their own
- Research foudn that highly talented people tend to make others jealous, placing them at risk of being disliked, resented, ostracized, and undermined
  - If they were givers though, they were less likely to have a target on their back
- Meyer's Code of Honor:
  - Show up, work hard, be kind, and take the high road
- When people act generously in groups, they earn _idiosyncrasy credits_ - positive impressions that accumulate in the minds of group members
- When takers present ideas for improvement, colleagues are skeptical of their intentions and write them off as self-serving
  - When presented by givers, colleagues listened and rewarded them for speaking up, knowing they were motivated by genuine desire to contribute

### The Responsibility Bias

- _Responsibility bias_ - exaggerating our own contributions relative to others' inputs
- Is mistake that takers are especially vulnerable, and it's partially driven by the desire to see and present ourselves positively
- Another factor at play that's more powerful and more flattering: information discrepancy
  - We have access to more information about our own contributions than the contributions of others
- Even when people are well intentioned, they tend to overvalue their own contributions and undervalue those of others
- The responsibility bias is a major source of failed collaborations
- As a taker, your driving force is to make sure you get more than you give
  - It's all too easy to believe that you have done the lion's share of the work
- As a giver, your driving force is achieving a collective result, not on claiming personal responsibility for that result
- The key to balancing our responsibility judgement is to focus our attention on what others havve contributed
- Givers are tough on themselves when things go badly but quick to congratulate others wwhen things go well
- _Psychological safety_ - The belief that you can take a risk without being penalized or punished
- It's givers who often create such an environment

### The Perspective Gap

- Sharing credit is only one piece of successful group work
- _Perspective gap_ - when we're not experiencing a pschologically or phsyically intense state, we dramaticallyy underestimate how much it will affect us
- In collaborations, takers rarely cross the perspective gap
  - They're so focused on their own viewpoints that they never end up seeing how others are reacting to their ideas and feedback
- In creative work, givers are motivated to benefit others, so they find ways to put themselves in other people's shoes
- Successful givers shift their frames of referenceto the recipient's perspective
- Research shows that when we take others' perspectives, we tend to stayy within our own frames of references
  - When we're giving a gift, we imagine the joy that we would experience in receiving the gifts that we're selecting. But this isn't the same joy that the recipient will experience because the recipient has a different set of preferences.
- The ability to imagine other people's perspectives, rather than getting stuck in our own, is a signature skill of successful givers in collaborations
- When you start your career, it's nature to see your peers as rivals
  
  > When you start out, you see other people as obstacles to your success. But that means your world will be full of obstacles, which is bad. When you start your career, naturally you're mainly interested in advancing yourself and promoting yourself.

- It's really important to have a good reputation.
  - It's not a zero-sum game.
