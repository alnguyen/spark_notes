  - Takers view success as attaining results that are superior to others'.
  - Matchers see success in terms of balancing individual accomplishments with fairness to others.
  - Givers characterize success as individual achievements that have a positive impact on others.
- Taking on a giver's definition of usccess may require dramatic changes in a way an organization hires, evaluates, rewards, and promotes people.
  - It means paying attention to more than just the productivity of individual people: paying attention to the ripple effects of this productivity on others.
  - If success required benefiting others, it's possible that takers and matchers would be more inclined to find otherish ways to advance personal and collective interests simultaneously.
