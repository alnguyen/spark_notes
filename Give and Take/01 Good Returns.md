# 01 Good Returns

## The Dangers and Rewards of Giving More Than You Get

- Conventional wisdom says, highly successful people have three things in common: motivation, ability, and opportunity.
  - To succeed, we need a combination of hard work, talent, and luck.
  - Story of Danny Shader and David Hornik highlights a fourth ingredient: success depends heavily on how we approach our interactions with other people.
  - Every time we interact with another person at work, we have a choice to make: do we try to claim as much value as we can, or contribute value without worrying about what we receive in return?
- _Takers_ have a distinctive signature: they like to get more than they give.
  - Takers believe that the world is a competitive, dog-eat-dog place.
  - To succeed, they need to be better than others.
  - Garden-variety takers aren't cruel or cutthroat; they're just cautious and self-protective.
  - "If I don't look out for myself first, no one will."
- In the workplace, _givers_ are a relatively rare breed.
  - They prefer to give more than they get.
  - They often pay more attention to what other people need from them.
- Givers and takers differ in their attitudes and actions toward other people.
  - Takers help others strategically, when the benefits to them outweight the personal costs.
  - Givers help whenever the benefots to others exceed the personal costs.
    - Alternatively, givers may not think about persoonal costs at all, helping others without expecting anything in return.
- In the workplace, give and take becomes complicated.
  - Professionally, acting purely as takers or givers are rare.
  - A third style exists, _matchers_
    - Strive to preserve an equal balance of giving and getting.
  - _Matchers_ operate on the principle of fairness: when they help others, they protect themselves by seeking reciprocity.
    - Relationships are governed by even exchanges of favors.
- In engineering, the least prooductive and effective engineers are givers.
  - In one study, the least successful engineers were those wwho gave more than they received.
  - They had the worst objective scores in their firm for the number of tasks, technical reports, and drawings completed--not to mention errors made, deadlines missed, and money wasted.
  - Going out of their way to help others prevented them from getting their own work done.
- Who is at the top of the success ladder then? _Givers_.
  - Data showed that the lowest productivity engineers are mostly givers.
  - Data also shows that engineers with the highest are also givers too.
  - The study whoed that engineers with the best objective scores for quantity and quality of resullts are those who consistently give more to their colleagues than they get.
  - tl;dr - The worst and best performers are _givers_. _Takers_ and _matchers_ are more likely to land in the middle.
- Some _givers_ do become pushovers and doormats. What separates the champs from the chumps?
  - Less about raw talent or aptitude, and more about the strategies givers use and the choices they make.
  - Givers are not necessarily nice and they're not necessarily altruistic.
  - Successful givers recognize that there's a big difference between taking and receiving.
    - Taking is using other people sollely for one's own gain.
    - Receiving is accepting help from others while maintaining a willingness to pay it back and forward.
  - Successful givers are those who are willing to ask for help when they need it.
- Difference between when a _giver_ and _taker_ succeeds
  - When _givers_ succeed, it spreads and cascades
  - When _takers_ win, there's usually someone else who loses.
  - Research shows that people tend to envy successful takers and look for ways to knock them down a notch.
  - In contrast, when _givers_ succeed, people are rooting for and supporting them.
  - It's easier to win if everybody wants you to win. If you don't make enemies out there, it's easier to succeed.
