# The Art of Motivation Maintenance

## Why some givers burn out but others are on fire

> The intelligent altruists, though less altruistic than the unintelligent altruists, will be fitter than both unintelligent altruists and selfish individuals.

- Success involves more than just capitalizing on the strengths of giving; It also requires avoiding the pitfalls
  - If people give away too much time, they end up sacrificing for their collaborators and network ties, at the expense of their own energy
  - The consequence: givers end up exhausted and unproductive
- Successful givers, it turns out, are just as ambitious as takers and matchers
- Takers score high in self-interest and low in other-interest: they aim to maximize their own success without much concern for others
- Givers score high in other-interest but they vary on self-interest
- Selfless givers have high other-interest and low self-interest
  - Selfless giving is a form of pathological altruism, which is defined by an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one's own needs
- Most people assume that self and other-interests are opposite ends of one continuum
  - You can in fact have both at the same time
- If takers are selfish and givers are selfless, successful givers are _otherish_--they care about benefiting others, but they also have ambitious goals for advancing their own self interests

  Concerns for      |LOW             |         HIGH
  Self-Interes  LOW | Apathetic      | Self-sacrificing: Givers
                HIGH| Selfish: Takers| Otherish: Successful Givers
```
- Selfless giving, in the absence of self-preservation instincts, easily becomes overwhelming
- Being otherish means being willing to give more than you receive, but still keeping your own interests in sight, using them as a guide for choosing when, where, how, and to whom you give
- When cooncern for others is coupled with concern for self, givers are less prone to burning out and getting burned
- Research shows that when people become burned out, their job performance suffers
  - Exhausted employees struggle to focus their attention and lack of energy to work their hardest, longest, and smartest, so the quality and quantity of their work takes a nosedive


## The Impact Vacuum: Givers Without a Cause

> The greatest untapped source of motivation is a sense of service to others.

- A remarkable principle of giver burnout: it has less to do with the amount of giving and more with the amount of feedback about the impact of that giving
- Givers don't burnout when they devote too much time and energy, they burn out when they're working with people in need but are unable to help effectively.
- The perception of impact serves as a buffer against stress, enabling employees to avoid burnout and maintain motivation and performance.
- A firsthand connection to impact can tilt people off all reciprocity styles in the giver direction
  - When people know how their work makes a difference, they feel energized to contribute more
- Having a greater impact is one of the reasons why giving more can actually help givers avoid burnout
- Change of context can bring renewed energy by making giving feel fresh again

## Otherish Choices: Chunking, Sprinkling, and the 100-Hour Mark of Volunteering

- When people give continually without concern for their well being, they're at risk for poor mental and physical health
- In one study, people who maintained equilibrium between benefiting themselves and others achieved significant increases in happiness and life satisfaction over a six month period
- In one study, spreading kindness over the course of a week may have diminished the salience and power or made them less distinguishable compared to chunking the acts of kindness into one day
- Chunking giving is an otherish strategy
- Selfless givers are more inclined to sprinkle their giving throughout their days, helping when people needed them
  - This can be highly distracting and exhausting, robbing selfless givers the attention and energy necessary to complete their work
- One hundred seems to be a magic number when it comes to giving
- In several studies, people who volunteered at least one hundred hours per year reported more happier and more likely to be alive
  - There were no benefits found for more than one hundred hours
  - It appears to be the range where giving ix maximally energizing and minimally draining
- Giving has an energizing effect only if it's an enjoyable, meaningful choice rather than undertaken out of duty and obligation
- Reasons for giving matters immensely
  - People who give out of a sense of enjoyment and purpose experience significant gains in energy
  - Giving for these reasons conferred a greater sense of autonomy, mastery, and connection to others, and it boosted their energy
- Selfless givers tend to feel uncomfortable receiving support
  - They are determined to be in the helper role, so they're reluctant to burden or inconvenience others
  - They receive far less support than otherish givers, which proves psychologically and physically costly
- Receiving support from colleagues is a robust antidote to burnout
- There is a stress response that differs from fight or flight
  - It's called tend and befriend
  - It mostly appears that otherish givers take advantage of this
  - It is the tendency to affiliate--tocome together in groups to provide and receive joint protection in threatening times
- Otherish givers build up a support network that they can access foor help when they need it

## The Myth of Giver Burnout

- Those who gave selflessly had the highest burnout
- Those who acted like matchers and takers were far less burnt out
- Otherish givers had significantly lower burnout rates than the rest
- One study shows that by consistently overriding their selfish impulses in order to help others, they had strengthened their psychological muscles, to the point where using willpower for painful tasks was no longer exhausting
- Other studies show that givers accrue an advantage in controlling their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors
- One study shows that people who give more go on to earn more
  - Research shows that giving can boost happiness and meaning, motivating people to work harder and earn more money, even if the gift isn't on a colossal scale
- Helper's High - Neuoscienec shows that giving actually activates the rewards and meaning centers on our brains, which sends us pleasure and purpose signals when we act for the benefit of others
- Otherish givers actually give more than selfless givers
  - Otherish givers may appear less altruistic than selfless givers, but their resilience against burnout enables them to contribute more
