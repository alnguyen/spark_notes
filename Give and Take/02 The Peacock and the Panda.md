# 02 The Peacock and the Panda

## How takers, matchers, and givers build networks

- Networks come with three major advantages: private information, diverse skills, and power.
  - By developing a strong network, people can gain invaluable access to knowledge, expertise, and influence.
  - Research demonstrates that people with rich networks achieve higher performance ratings, get promoted faster, and earn more money.
  - Because netwworks are based on interactions and relationships, they serve as a powerful prism for understanding the impact of reciprocity styles on success.

### Spotting the Taker in a Giver's Clothes

- Kissing up, kicking down
- > The true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him absolutely no good. - Samuel Johnson
- Most people are matchers: their core values emphasize fairness, equality, and reciprocity.
  - When takers violate these principles, matchers in their networks believe in an eye for an eye, so they want to see justice served.
- Why do we punish takers for being unfair?
  - It's about justice.
  - If you're a matcher, you'll also punish takers for acting unfairlyy toward other people.
- Since takers tend to be self-absorbed, they're more likely to use first-person singular pronouns like I, me, mine, my, and myself--versus first-person plural pronouns like we, is, our, ours, and ourselves.
- Another signal of a taker is compensation.
  - Taker CEOs earned far more than other senior executives in their companies.
  - Takers see themselves as superior, so they feel entitled to substantial pay discrepancies in their own favor.
- For takers, it's all about me.

### The Transparent Network

- Takers post information that was rated as more self-promoting, self-absorbed, and self-important.
  - They featured quotes that were evaluated as boastful and arrogant.
  - Takers also had significantly more Facebook friends, racking up superficial connections so they could advertise their accomplishments and stay in touch to get favors.

### What Goes Around Comes Around

- Takers and matchers also give in the context of networks, but they tend to give them strategically, with an expected personal return that exceeds or equals their contributions
  - When takers and matchers netwwork, they tend to focus on who can help them in the near future, and this dictates what, where, and how they give
- Reciprocity is a powerful norm, but it comes with two downsides, both of which contribute to the cautiousness with which many of us approach networking.
  - People on the receiving end often feel like they're being manipulated
  - They tend to build smaller networks than either givers, who actively seek to help a wider range of people, or takers who often find themselves expanding their networks to compensate for bridgers burned in previous transactions.
    - Matchers tend to be the most vulnerable here.

#### Waking the Sleeping Giants

- Surprisingly, people were significantly more likely to benefit from weak ties.
  - Strong ties provide bonds, but weak ties serve as bridges: they provide more efficient access to new information.
  - Strong ties tend to travel in the same social circles and know about the same opportunities as we do.
  - Weak ties are more likely to open up access to a different network, facilitating the discovery of original leads.
- It's tough to ask weak ties for help.
  - Although they're the faster route to new leads, we don't always feel comfortable reaching out.
- It's possible to get the best of both worlds: the trust of strong ties and the novel information of weak ties.
  - The key is reconnecting, and it's a major reason why givers succeed in the long run.
- _Pronoia_ - the delusional belief that other people are plotting your well-being, or saying nice things about you behind your back.
- Just as matchers will sacrifice their own interests to punish takers who act selfishly towards others, they'll go out of their way to reward givers who act generously towards others.

#### Doromant Ties

- Dormant ties provided more novel information than current ties
  - While out of touch, they had been exposed to new ideas and perspectives
  - Current ties were more likely to share the knowlledge base and viewpoints that were already possessed
- Reconnecting a dormant relationship is like starting from scratch--there are still feelings of trust
- Reconnecting is difficult for takers
- Reconnecting is difficult for matchers but easier than for takers due to the fidelity to the norm of reciprocity
- Takers are like black holes, sucking energy from those around them.
- Givers inject light around
  - Creating opportunities for their colleagues to contribute, rather than imposing their ideas and hogging credit for achievements.
- We should see networks as a vehicle for creating value for everyone, not just for ourselves.

#### The Five-Minute Favor

- You should be willing to do something that will take you five minutes or less for _anybody_
- Giving, especially when it's distinctive and consistent, establishes a pattern that shifts the reciprocity styles within a group
- When people walk intoo a new situation, they look to others for clues about appropriate behavior
- When groups included one consistent giver, the other members contributed more
- Can givers maintain their productivity, especially when there are no guarantees that their help will come back around to benefit them directly?
  - Takers have the least respect amongst their peers
  - Givers had highest status
  - Despite the highest esteem, givers paid a productivity price
  - Givers were more productive than the takers: they worked harder and got more done
  - Matchers had that highest productivity, beating the givers
  - Givers devoted time to help their colleagues which detracted from their ability to finish work
  - Matchers were more likely to call in favors and receive help
  - Givers only took a productivity dive when they gave infrequently
  - The most productive were those who gave often and gave more than they received
- If your interactions are ruled by generosity, your rewards will follow suit
