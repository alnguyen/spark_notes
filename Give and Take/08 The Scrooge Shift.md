# 08 The Scrooge Shift

## Why a Soccer Team, a Fingerprinnt, and a Name Can Tilt Us in the Other Direction

- When dealing with individuals, it's sensible for givers to protect themselves by engaging in sincerity screening and acting primarily like matchers in exchanges with takers.
  - In group settings, there's a different way for givers to protect themselves: get everyone in the group to act more like givers.
  - If a group develops a norm of giving, members will uphold the norm and give, even if they're more inclined to be takers or matchers elsewhere.

## The Altruism Debate

- Is the decision to give purely altruistic or is it ultimately selfish?
- The defendant of pure altruism, C. Daniel Batson, believes we engage in truly selfless giving when we feel empathy for another person in need.
  - The greater the need, the more we empathize.
  - When we empathize, we focus our time and energy helping someone--not because it makes us feel good, but because we genuinely care.
- The devil's advocate, Robert Cialdini, argues that there's no such thing as pure altruism.
  - The argument is that when we see others in need, we feel distresesd, sad, or guilty. To reduce our own negative feelings, we help.
- While it's true that people sometimes help to reduce negative feelings, it isn't the only reason, according to Batson.
  - We can reduce negative feelings in other ways, such as distractions or escaping the situation altogether.
  - To tease apart whether empathy drives us to help, Batson came up with the following:
    - If the goal is to reduce our own distress, we should choose whatever course of action makes us feel better.
    - If the goal is to reduce another person's distress, we should help even when it's costly and other courses of action would make us feel good.
  - Batson ran an experiment with participants to watch a woman receive electric shocks.
    - The folks who empathized the most stayed and offered to take the shocks in her place.
  - Other studies help show that Batson was correct.
- Cialdini believed that when we empathize with a victim in need, we become so emotionally attached that we experience a sense of oneness with the victim.
  - We see more of ourselves in the victim and this is why we help: we're really helping ourselves.
  - Cialdini conducted experiements supporting this idea.
- Both camps agree that empathy leads to helping.
  - Both camps agree that a sense of oneness is a key reason why.
  - They differ about whether oneness is selfish or altruistic.
- People who initially give things away for selfish reasons begin to care about the people they're helping
- Oneness is otherish
  - Takers and matchers may be most likely to give when they feel they can advance others' interests and their own at the same time.
- Example: Why do volunteers contribute to Wikipedia?
  - For many, writing entries is otherish: it provides personal enjoyment and benefits others

## From Enemies to Allies

- Common ground is a major influence on giving behaviors.
- When people share an identity with another person, giving to that person takes on an otherish quality.
  - If we help people who belong to our group, we're also helping ourselves, as we're making the group better off.
- Receiving is a fundamentally different experience in generalized giving and direct matching systems.
  - The first distinction lies in the terms of the exchange.
    - In direct matching, the exchange is an economic transaction.
    - In generalized giving, givers aren't getting anything tangible back from the recipients.
  - The second distinction has to do with who's responsible for the benefits you receive.
    - In generalized giving, the community is the source of the gifts you receive.
      - An effective system of generalized giving typicallly involves cycles of exchange with the following structure: person A gives to person B, who gives to person C.
    - In direct matching, participants will be less inclinsed to identify with the group because they will be less likely to derive the emotional experience of group membership.
- Once identification with a group happens, people are willing to give freely to anyone who shares the group identity.
  - Takers can feel like they're not losing anything of value, yet maintain the norm of giving so they can still get free stuff when they want it.
  - Matchers pay it forward because there's no way to pay it back.
- When people receive help from one peer, they are more likely to give help to another peer, matching by following the norm of social responsibility.
- Not all individuals and groups are equally likely to attract community identification.

## The Search For Optimal Distinctiveness

- We seem to prefer people, places, and things that remind us of ourselves.
- Across five studies, it was found that people are unusually likely to end up living in places that resemble their first names.
  - Example: People named Jack are four times more likely to end up living in Jacksonville than people named Phillip.
  - People are also more likely to move to places that resemble their names
- Turns out, it works for careers too
  - There were more people named Dennis who were dentists in the US than Jerrys or Walters even though the names were all equally common
- This attraction also holds for products and people that we associate with ourselves
- Evidence shows that similarity can influence whom we decide to help.
- People are more likely to give microloans to borrowers who shared their first initials or their occupations.
- People are more enthusiastic, friendly, and open-minded when they meet someone who reminds them of themselves.
- Uncommon commonality drives people to act like givers.
  - Name-similarity effects on where we live, what careers we choose, and whom we marry are stronger for people with rare names than common names.
  - We gravitate toward people, places, and products with which we share an uncommon commonality.
- Why are uncommon commonalities so transformative?
  - One theory, from psychologist Marilynn Brewer, states

  > On one hand, we want to fit in: we strive for connection, cohesiveness, community, belonging, inclusion, and affiliation with others. On the other hand, we want to stand out: we search for uniqueness, differentiation, and individuality. As we navigate the social world, these two motives are often in conflict. The more strongly we affiliate with a group, the greater our risk of losing our sense of uniqueness. The more we work to distinguish ourselves from others, the greater our risk of losing our sense of belongingness.

- The principle of _optimal distinctiveness_ - we look for ways to fit in and stand out.
  - Like joining a unique group.
  - Being part of a group with shared commonalities gives us a sense of connection and belonging.
  - Being part of a group that is clearly distinct from other groups gives us a sense of uniqueness.
  - People are happier in groups that provide optimal distinctiveness, giving a sense of both uniqueness and inclusion.

## Why Supermann Backfires and People Conserve Electricity

- _Elevation_ - the warm feeling of being moved by others' act of giving, which can "seem to push a mental 'reset button,' wiping out feelings of cynicism and replacing them with a sense of moral inspiration"
  - When elevated, we feel as though we have become (for a moment) less selfish, and we want to act accordingly.
- In a study, people were asked to list out ten features of a superhero or ten features of Superman. The folks who listed features of a superhero were more likely to volunteer than those who listed features of superman.
  - When people think about the general attributes of superheroes, they generate a list of desireable characteristics that they can relate to themselves.
- The act of legitimizing small contributions draws in takers, making it difficult and embarrassing for them to say no, without dramatically reducing the amount given by takers.
  - Example: Adding "even a penny wil help" to a phrase to ask people for monetary donations.
- When people join a group, they look for cues about appropriate behavior.
- The visibility of giving can affect reciprocity styles.
- People are most influenced by similar others.
  - The power of social norms grows stronger the closer and more similar the group was to the individual.
- People often take because they don't realize that they're deviating from the norm.
  - In these situations, showing them the norm is often enough to motivate them to give--especially if they have matcher instincts.

## The Reciprocity Ring

- An exercise where each individual within a group to make a request for help and the group would try to use their knowledge, resources, and connections, to help fulfill the request.
- We tend to underestimate the number of people who are willing to give. Why?
  - When we try to predict others' reactions, we focus on the costs of saying yes, overlooking the costs of saying no.
  - It's uncomfortable, guilt-provoking, and embarrassing to turn down a small request for help.
- Workplaces and schools are often designed to be zero-sum environments, with forced rankings and required grading curves that pit group members against one another ina win-lose contest.
  - It's natural in these environments to assume that peers will lean in the taker direction, so people hold back on giving.
  - This reduces the amount of giving that occurs, thus leading to the underestimation of people who are interested in giving.
  - Over time, people with giver values begin to feel that they're in the minority.
  - This results in people disguising their giving behind purely self-interested motives.
- People, particularly in the US, don't like to admit that they were genuinely helpful, kind, generous, caring or compassionate because there are social norms against sounding too charitable.
  - They are often called "bleeding hearts" or "do-gooders"
- This creates a situation where no one belives, but everyone thinks that everyone believes.
- Ideas can have profound effects even when they are false.
  - When people assume that others aren't givers, they act and speak in ways that discourage others from giving, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.
- People are often reluctant to ask for help, being too embarrassed to look incompetent or needy.
  - The Reciprocity Ring exercise is designed to disrupt this because everyone is making a request, there is no reason to be embarrassed.
  - The Reciprocity Ring generally starts with givers stepping up as role models for contributions.
- Because people often present meaningful requests in Reciprocity Rings, many matchers are drawn in by empathy.
- Being a pure matcher in the Reciprocity Ring is extremely difficult since it's unlikely that the people you help will be the same people who can help fulfill your request.
  - So the easiest way to be a matcher is to contribute the same amount that other people do.
- The Reciprocity Ring's key is in making giving public
  - Takers know that they'll gain reputational benefits for being generous in sharing. If they don't, they look stingy and selfish, and won't get help with their own requests.
- Research shows that givers usually contribute regardless of whether it's public or private, but takers are more likely to contribute when it's public.

## Identity Shifts and Reciprocity Reversals

- People who went public with their intentions to engage in an identity relevant behavior were significantly less likely to engage in the behavior than people who kept their intentions private.
  - Example: When Harvard students signed a kindness pledge, they are able to establish an image as givers without need to act like givers.
  - When signing some sort of pledge, people can establish credentials as givers, which may grant them a psychological license to give less--or take more.
- Influence is far more power when we change people's behaviors first, before changing their attitudes.
  - To turn takers into givers, it's often necessary to convince them to start giving.
  - Over time, if the conditions are right, they'll come to see themselves as givers.
- One study shows that if they can attribute their giving to an external reason, like a promotion, people don't start to think of themselves as givers.
- When people make the personal choice to give to others, they start to internalize giving as part of their identities.
  - For some, this happens through an active process of cognitive dissonance: once I've made the voluntary decision to give, I can't change the behavior, so the easiest way to stay consistent and avoid hypocrisy is to decide that I'm a giver.
  - For others, the internalization process is one of learning from observing their own behaviors.
    - "How do I know who I am until I see what I do?"
- The longer someone volunteers and more time they give, the more they begin to view the volunteering role as an important aspect of their identities.
  - They begin to experience a common identity with the people they're helping and become givers in that role.
  - Research shows a similar process inside companies: as people make voluntary decisions to help colleagues and customers beyond the scope of their jobs, they come to see themselves as organizational citizens.
