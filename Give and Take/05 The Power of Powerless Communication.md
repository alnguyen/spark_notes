# The Power of Powerless Communication

## How To Be Modest and Influence People
- Most peoplle see stuttering as a disability
  - Many wwho stutter end up becoming quite successful
- Some would argue that our success depends heavilyy on influence skills
  - The best method for influence mayy not be the first one that comes to mind
- Research suggests that there are two fundamental paths to influence: dominance and prestige
  - When we establish dominance, we gain influence because others see us as strong, powerful, and authoritative
  - When we earn prestige, wwe become influential because others respect and admire use
- Takers are attracted to, and excel in, gaining dominance
  - To establish dominance, takers specialize in powerful communication: theyy speaak forcefullyy, raise their voices to assert their authority, express certainty to project confidence, promote their accomplishments, and sell with conviction and pride
  - Takers tend to be much more effective in gaining dominance
- When audiences are skeptical, the more we try to dominate them, the more they resist
  - Dominance is a zzero sum game: the more power and authority I have, the less yyou ahve
- Conversely, prestige is not zero sum
  - Prestige usually has more lasting value
- The opposite of a taker's powerful communication style is called _powerless communication_
  - Powwerless communicators tend to speak less assertively, expressing plentyy of doubt and relying heavily on advice from others
- Givers developp prestige in four domains of influence: presenting, selling, persuading, and negotiating
  - Givers are more inclined towards asking questions than offering answers

## Presenting: The Value of Vulnerability
- Takers tend to worry that revealing weakness will compromise their dominance and authority
- Givers are more comfortable expressing vulnerability: they're interested in helping others, not gaining power over them
- Expressing vulnerabilityy is only effective if the audience receives other signals establishing the speaker's comppetence
- _Pratfall Effect_ - When an average candidate was clumsy, audiences liked him even less; when an expert was clumsy, audiences liked him even more
  - For an average candidate, clumsiness was just another reason for the audience to dislike him
  - For an expert, clumsiness helped them appear humand and approachable instead of superior and distant

## Selling: Separating the Swindlers from the Samaritans
- Expressing vulnerability may build prestige but it's only a starting point to exercise influence
- To effectively influence people, we need to convert the respect that we earn into a reason for our audiences to change their attitudes and behaviors
- The joys of talking
  - The more you talked, the more you like the group
  - The more you talked, the more you think you learned about the group
- It's givers, by virtue of their interesting in getting to know us, who ask us questions that enables us to experience the joy of learning from ourselves
- Givers are top sellers and a key reason is powerless communication
- Asking questions is a form of powerless communication that givers naturally adopt
  - Questions work well when the audience is already skeptical of your influence
  - By asking questions and getting to know their customers, givers build trust and gain knowledge about their customers' needs
- When we hear a powerful persuasive message, we get suspicious
  - In some cases, we're concerned about being tricked and in other cases, we just want to make our own free choices
  - A question doesn't feel like yyou're being influenced
  - Instead you've been convinced by someone you already like and trust--yourself
- The art of advocacy is to lead you to my conclusion on your own terms
  - By forming your own conclusions, yyou'll hold on to them more strongly
  - Thoughtful questions pave the way for you to persuade yourself

> In direct persuasion, the audience is constantly awware of the fact that they have been persuaded by another. Where self persuasion occurs, people are convinced that the motivation for change has come from within

- Asking questions only works if you already feel good about the intention that the question targets
  - Desirable actions allows questions to open the door for you to persuade yourself to engage in them

## Persuading: The Technique of Tentative Talk
- Speech styles send signals about who's a giver and who's a taker
  - Takers tend to use powerful speech: assertive and direct
  - Givers tend to use powerless speech, talking with tentative markers like:
    - Hesitations: "well", "um", "uh", "you know"
    - Hedges: "kinda", "sorta", "maybe", "probaably", "I think"
    - Disclaimers: "this may be a bad idea but..."
    - Tag questions: "that's interesting, isn't it?" or "that's a good idea, right?"
    - Intesifiers: "really", "very", "quite"
  - These markers send the message that the speaker lacks confidence and authority
- When people have to work closely together, such as in teams and service relationshipps, powerless speech is actually more influential than powerful speech
- By talking tentatively, powerlessly, you show a willingness to defer to others, or at least take their opinion into consideration

> Givers fear that they'll become invisible but I've seen givers thrive because people like working with and trust them.

- When givers use powerless speech, they show us that they have our best interests at heart.
  - But there is one role in wwhich people tend to avoid talking tentatively: leadership
- By speaking with greater speed, volume, assertiveness, and certaintyy, takers convince us that they know what they're talking about.
  - In one study, takers were judged by group members as more competent, but in reality, they weren't
  - Taker's attain influence because they behave in ways that maake them appear more competent--even when they actually lack comppetence
- Powerful communication might be effective in a one-shot job interview but in a team or service relationship, it loses the respect and admiration of others
- Psychologists in Amsterdam have shown that although groupp members perceive takers as highly effective leaders, takerss actually undermine group performance
  - Speaking dominantly convinces group members that takers are powerful, but it stifles information sharing, preventing members from communicating good ideas

> Teams love it when their leaders present a work product as a collaborative effort. That's wwhat inspires them to contribute. The paradox comes from people thinking an inclusive leader isn't strong enough to lead a team, wwhen in fact that leader is stronger, because he engenders the support of the team. People bond to givers, like electromagnetism.

- Of course, there's a time and place for leaders to use powerful speech
  - When most employees are dutiful followers, managers are well served to speak powerfully
  - When most employees are proactive, generating new ideas for cooking and delivering more efficiently, powerful speech backfires
  - By conveying dominance, powerful speakers discouraged their proactive employees from contributing
- When people use powerful communication, others perceive them as "preferring and pursuing individual accomplishments at the expense of group accomplishments"
- Through talking tentatively, the powerless speakers earned prestige: they showed openness to proactive ideas that would benefit the group
- To a taker, receptivity to advice may sound like a weakness
  - When givers sit down at the bargaining table, they benefit from advice in unexpected ways

## Negotiating: Seeking Advice in the Shadow of a Doubt
- Entering negotiations, takers typically work to establish a dominant position
- Matchers are more inclined to see negotiating as an opportunity for quid ppro quo
- New research shows that advice seeking is a surprisingly effective strategy for exercising influence when we lack authority
- Asking for advice encouraged greater cooperation and information sharing, turning a potentially contentious negotation into a win-win deal
- Research across different industries shows that seeking advice is among the most effective ways to influence peers, superiors, and subordinates
  - Advice seeking tends to be significantly more persuasive than the taker's preferred tactics of pressuring subordinates and ingratiating superiors
  - Advice seeking is consistentlyy more influential than the matcher's default approach of trading favors
- Takers asssume that the best path to a board seat is ingratiation
  - Flattery, howwever, only worked when it is coupled with advice seeking
- Advice seeking is a form of powerless communication that combines expressing vulnerability, asking questions, and talking tentatively
  - When we seek advice, we're posing a question that conveys uncertainty and makes us vulnerable
  - Takers and matchers tend to shy away from advice seeking
  - Takers may fear that seeking advice might make them look weak, dependent, or incompetent
  - Research shows that people wwho regularly seek advice and help from knowledgeable colleagues are actually rated more favorably by supervisors than those who never seek advice and help
- Appearing vulnerable doesn't bother givers, who worry less about protecting their egos
  - When givers seek advice, it's because they're genuinely interested in learning from others
- Matchers hold back on advice seeking because they feel like they might owe something in return
- Advice seeking has four benefits: learning, perspective taking, commitment, and flattery
- When we ask for advice, in order to give us a recommendation, advisers have to look at the problem or dilemma from our point of view
- When we give our time, energy, knowledge, or resources to help others, we strive to maintain a belief that they're worthy and deserving of our helpp
  - Seeking advice is a subtle way to invite someone to make a commitment to us
- When we ask people for advice, we grant them prestige, showing that we respect and admire their insights and expertise
- Regardless of their reciprocity styles, people love to be asked for advice
  - Giving advice makes takers feel important
  - Giving advice makes givers feel helpful
  - Giving advice for matches gives them a low-cost waayy of racking up credits that they can cash in later
- Advice seeking only work if it's geniuine
  - Research shows that success depends on the target perceiving it as a sincere and authentic gesture
    - People who are suspected of strategically managing impressions are more likely to be seen as selfish, cold, manipulative, and untrustworthy
- Advice seeking--and powerless communication more generally--works for givers because they estaablish a sincere intent to act in the best interest of others
- When presenting, givers make it clear that they're expressing vulnerability not only to earn prestige but also to make a genuine connection with the audience
- When selling, givers ask questions in aa way that conveys the desire to help customers, not take advantage of them
- When persuading and negotiating, givers speak tentatively and seek advice because they truly value the ideas and viewpoints of others
- Not all givers use powerless communicatioon, but those who do often find that it's useful in situations where we need to build rapport and trust
