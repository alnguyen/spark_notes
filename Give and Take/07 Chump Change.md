# 07 Chump Change

## Overcoming the Doormat Effect

- Three major traps that plague givers are being too trusting, too empathetic, and too timid
  - Being an otherish giver can help avoid these

## Sincerity Screening: Trusting Most of the People Most of the Time

- Trust is one reason that givers are so susceptible to the doormat effect: they tend to see the best in everyone, so they operate on the mistaken assumption that everyone is trustworthy
- Successful givers need to know who's likely to manipulate them so that they can protect themselves
- To judge givers, we often rely on personality cues, but these cues can be misleading
- Agreeableness - a personality trait that distinguishes how people tend to appear in their social interactions
  - Agreeable people tend to appear cooperative and polite--they seek harmony with others, coming across as warm, nice, and welcoming
  - Disagreeable people tend to be more competitive, critical, and tough--they're more comfortable with conflict, coming across as skeptical and challenging
- Giving and taking are based on our motives and values, and they're choices that we make regardless of whether our personalities trend agreeable or disagreeable
- Four combinations
  - Agreeable givers
  - Disagreeable givers
    - People who are tough and tough in demeanor, but ultimately generous with their time, expertise, and connections
  - Agreeable takers
    - Also knows as the faker--people who come across as pleasant and charming, but they're often aiming to get much more than they give
  - Disagreeable Takers
- Givers tend to be more accurate judges of others than matchers and takers
- Over time, givers become sensitive to individual differences and shades of grey between the black-and-white boxes of agreeable and disagreeable
- Givers can often become doormats and get burned by takers by not using their knowledge of differences between veneers and motives
  - The inclination towards give first and ask questions later often comes at the expense of sincerity screening
- Once givers start to use their skills in sincerity screening to identify potential takers, they know when to put up their guard
  - Sometimes, this awareness sets in too late

## Generous Tit for Tat: The Adaptable Giver

- Empathy - the powerful emotion that we experience when we imagine another person's distress.
  - It is a pervasive force behind giving behaviors, but it's also a major source of vulnerability
- One one study, selfless givers' default approach to negotiations is to empathize and give in right away, regardless of their own interests
  - People who agreed with statements like, "I always place the needs of others above my own" were anxious about putting strain on the relationship, so they accommodated their counterparts by giving away value
- Studies show that when we empathize at the bargaining table, focusing on our counterparts' emotions and feelings puts us at risk of giving away too much
  - When we engage in perspective taking, considering our counterparts' thoughts and interests, we're more likely to find ways to make deals that satisfy our counterparts without sacrificing our own interests
- Trust but verify
- Once successful givers see the value of sincerityy screening and begin to spot agreeable takers as potential fakers, they protect themselves by adjusting their behavior accordingly
- How givers avoid getting burned: they become matchers in their exchanges with takers
  - It's wise to start out as a giver, since research shows that trust is hard to build but easy to destroy
  - Once a counterpart is clearly acting like a taker, it makes sense for givers to flex their reciprocity styles and shift to a matching strategy
- _Tit for tat_ - A pure matcher strategy: start out cooperating, and stay cooperative unless your counterpart competes
  - When your counterpart competes, match the behavior and compete as well
  - Suffers from a fatal flaw of not being forvgiving enough to stomach the occasional mishap
- _Generous tit for tat_
  - Never forget a good turn, but occasionally forgive a bad one
  - Start out cooperating and continue until your counterpart competes.
  - When your counterpart competes, instead of always responding competitively, compete two thirds of the time, acting cooperatively in response to one of every three defections
  - Achieves a powerful balance of rewarding giving and discouraging taking, without being overly punitive
  - Risk: encourages most people to act like givers, which opens the door for takers to "rise up again" by competing when everyone else is cooperating
  - Is an otherish strategy
  - Where selfless givers make the mistake of trusting others all the time, otherish givers are willing to adjust their reciprocity styles in exchange with someone who appears to be a taker by action or reputation
- Being otherish means givers keep their own interests in the rearview mirror, taking care to trust but verify
- Otherish givers carry the optimistic belief that even takers will surprise and impress you

> Part of the value of ongoing dialogue is you can tell pretty quickl who is faking it, because good conversations and relationships build upon each other. It's easy to fake it every six months, but not on a regular basis. That's part of why I encourage people to schedule [1 on 1s]. It's part of how you sort out who's genuine while making the biggest impact. [Once I Identify a colleague as a taker], I don't help them less, but the help starts to look different. I'll listen and engage, but we're not having a dialogue; there's not as much mentoring and coaching. It's not that I will consciously be less vailable to support them, but human nature leads you to invest your time where there is the biggest return--for both of us.

## Assertiveness and the Advocacy Paradox

- Several studies show that men are more likely to show willingness to negotiate their salary
  - Men were 8.3 times more likely to ask for more money than women in one study
  - Research shows that one of the main reasons that women tend to negotiate less assertively than men is that they worry about violating social expectations that they'll be warm and kind
- This doormat effect is a curse that afflicts givers, regardless of gender
  - In several studies, givers were willing to make large concessions just to reach an agreement that would make their counterparts happy, even if they had better options available
- As we saw earlier on powerless communication, givers tend to be humble and uncomfortable asserting themselves directly
  - Studies show that in zero-sum situations, givers frequently shy away from advocating for their own interests
- How does a giver become more assertive in negotiations? Instead of negotiation on their own behalf, pretend that they are advocating for someone else
- According to researchers, in short-term, single-issue negotiations, givers do worse than takers, because they're willing to give larger slices of the pie to their counterparts.
  - This disadvantage disappears entirely when givers set high goals and stick to them, which is easier for givers to do when advocating for someone else.
  - Example: Instead of representing one's own interests, shift your frame of mind to one representing your family's interests
  
  > I used it as a psychological weapon against myself, to motivate myself. The solution was thinking about myself as an agent, an advocate for my family. As a giver, I feel guilty about pushing too much, but the minute I start thinking, "I'm hurting my family, who'se depending on me for this," I don't feel guilty about pushing for that side.

  - This is an otherish strategy.
  - On one hand you're doing what givers do naturally: advocating on other people's interests.
    - On the other hand, you're advocating for your family, whose interests were closely aligned with your own.
- Givers, particularly agreeable ones, often overestimate the degree to which assertiveness might be off-putting to others.
- _Relational account_ - an explanation for a request that highlights concern for the interest of others, not only oneself
- Givers worry about violating their own reciprocity preferences
  - When givers are advocating for someone else, pushing is closely aligned with their values of protecting and promoting the interests of others: givers can chalk it up to caring

## Pushing Past Pushover

- In a comprehensive analysis of different studies, the best negotiators weren't takers or selfless givers.
  - Takers focused on claiming value: they saw negotiations as zero-sum, win-lose, contests and didn't trust their opponents, so they bargained aggressively, overlooking opportunities to create value through developing an understanding of their counterparts at a personal cost.
  - Most effective negoatiators were otherish: they reported high concern for their own interests and high concern for their counterparts' interests.

> If you have a natural mix of givers, takers, and matchers in your company, you can do a lot to magnify the giver tendency, suppress the more aggressive taker tendencies, and shift the matchers toward giving.

- Successful givers recognize that their choices shape the results they achieve in competitive, confrontational situations.
  - The danger lies in the rigidity of sticking with a single reciprocity style across all interactions and relationships.
