# 04 Finding the Diamond in the Rough

## The fact and fiction of recognizing potential
- Spotting and cultivating talent are essential skillls in just about every industry
- As with networking and collaboration, when it comes to discovering the potential in others, reciprocity styles shape our approaches and effectiveness

## Star Search
- Recognize the possible power and influence in 
  - (a) having a genuine interest and belief in the potential of their employees
  - (b) engaging in actions that support others and communicate that belief, increasing others' motivation and effort and helping them achieve that potential
- Takers tend to place little trust in other people, thus not seeing people as bloomers
  - They assume that most people are takers and hold relatively low expectaations for the potential of their peers and subordinates
  - These low expectations trigger aa vicious cycle, constraining the development and motivvation of others
  - They're more likely to see talent and potential as a threat and be less willing to support and develop them
  - Taakers frequently fail to engage in the supportive behaviors that are conducive to the confidence and development of their peers aand subordinatess
- Matchers are better equipped to inspire self-fulfilling prophecies
  - Whenn a peer or subordinate shows high potential, theyy'll go out of their way to support, encourage, and develop their promising colleagues
  - Their mistake lies in waiting for signs of high potential
  - They will wait to offer support until they see evidence of promise
- Givers don't wait for signs of potential because they tend to be optimistic and trusting of other's intentions
  - As leaders, managers, and mentors, they are inclined to see the potential in everyone
  - By default, they start by seeing people as bloomers

## Polishing the Diamond in the Rough
- Success doesn't measure a human being, effort does
- The identification of talent may be the wrong place to start
- Interest is what drives people to invest their time and energy in developing particular skills and bases of knowledge
  - Motivation is the reason that people develop talent in the first place
- Attaining expertise in a domain often requires ten thousand hours of deliberate practice
  - What motivates people to practice at such length? This is where givers enter the picture.
- In roles as leaders and mentors, givers resist the temptation to search for talent first
  - By recognizing that anyone can be a bloomer, givers focus their attention on motivation
- _Grit_ - Having passion and perseverance toward long term goals
- Above and beyond intelligence and aptitude, gritty people--by virtue of their interest, focus, and drive--achieve higher performance
  - You can't take motivation for granted
- Of course natural talent matters, but after you haave a pool of candidates above the threshold of necessary potential, grit is a major factor that predicts how close they get to achieving their potential
- Givers get the greatest return on their investment and most meaningful impact by focusing on gritty peoplle
- Givers strive to cultivate grit in the first place

> Seeing high exppectaations is important. You have to push people, make them stretch and do more than they think possible. When they take my tessts, I want them thinking it was the toughest exam they've ever seen in their lives. It makes them better learners. Theyy need to make a significant investment, and it pays off. Forcinng them to work harder than they ever have in their lives benefits them in the long run.

- One of the keys to cultivating grit is making the task at hand more interesting and motivating.

## Throwing Good Money After Bad Talent

- Because they see potential all around them, givers end up investing a lot of their time in encouraging and developping people to achieve this potential.
  - These investments don't always pay off; some candidates lack the raw talent, and others don't sustain their passion or maintain the requisite level of grit
- In most work organizations, we face more limits: making a bet on one person's potential means passing on others
- The moment a taker realizes that someone isn't contributing to their teaam's success, they wouldn't feel any sense of responsibilityy to them
- For a matcher, they would grow frustrated that their investment was not being recipprocated or rewarded
- It might seem that givers have a hard time letting go, but it turns out that givers are the leasst vulnerable to the mistake of over investing in people

## Facing the Mirror: Looking Good or Doing Good
- _Escalation of commitment_ - when an investmennt doesn't pay off, even if the expected value is negative, we invest more.
- _Sunk cost fallacy_ - when estimating the value of a future investment, we have trouble ignoring what we've already invested in the past
- Sunk costs have a small effect--decision makers are biased in favor of their previous investments--but three other factors are more powerful
  - Anticipated regret: will I be sorry that I didn't give this another chance?
  - Project completion: if I keep investing, I can finish the project
  - Ego threat: If I don't keep investing, I'll look and feel llike a fool
    - In response, people invest more, hoping to turn the project into a success so they can prove to others--and themselves--that they were right all along
- Research suggests that due to their susceptibilityy to ego threat, takers are more vulnerable to escalation of commitment than givers
- Takers felt responsible for an investment that was going bad, so they committed more to protect their pride and save face
  - Because escalating their commitment allows the decision maker to keep the project faailure hidden, such behavior is personally rational from the perspective of a taker
- Givers tend to primarily be concerned about protecting other people and the organization, so they are more willing to admit their initial mistakes and de-escalate their commitment
- Studies show that people make more accurate and creative decisions when theyy're choosing on behalf of others
  - When people make decisions in a self foocused state, they're more likely to be biased by ego threat and often agnoize over trying to find a choice that's ideal in aall possible dimensions
  - When people focus on others, they're less likely to worry about egos and miniscule details. They look at the big picture and prioritize what matters most to others
- A major reason why givers are less vulnerable than takers to escalation of commitment has to do with responses to feedback and how they react to information about their performance
- When they believed they were above average, takers followed suggestions 30% more often
  - When they believed they were below average, they followed suggestions only 15% more often
  - Once theyy felt criticized, they were less willing to aaccept recommendations for improvement
- Givers accepted the criticism and followed suggestion
  - Even when theyy received negative feedback indicating they were below average, they followed suggestions 30% more often
- In escalation situations, takers often struggle to face the reality that an initial choice has gone bad.
  - They tend to discount social information and performance feedback that does not support their favorable view of themselves
- Givers may be more apt to accept and act on social information without carefully evaluating the personal consequences
  - They focus more on the interpersonal and organizational consequences of their decisions, accepting a blow to their pride and reputations in the short term in order to make better choices in the long term

## Glimpsing Glimmers in Chunks of Coal
- Givers are undervalued by many teams, since they don't hog the spotlight
- There's a connection between grit and giving
  - Because of their dedication to others, givers are willing to work harder and longer than takers and matchers
  - Givers continue exerting effort out of a sense of responsibility to their team
- Gritty givers would be willing to put the good of the team above their personal interests, working hard to fulfill the roles for which they were needed
- Whereas takers often strive to be the smartest people in the room, givers are more receptive to expertise from leaders, even if it challengers their own beliefs
- Givers don't excel only at recognizing and developing talent, they're also surprisingly good at moving on when their bets don't work out
