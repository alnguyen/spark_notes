# Chapter 1: The Problem With Org Charts
----

> Organization that rely too heavily on org charts and matrixes to split and control work often fail to create the necessary conditions to embrace innovation while still delivering at a fast pace. In order to succeed at that, organizations need stable teams and effect tea patterns and interactions.

> The organizational structure must coordinate accountabilities to support the goals of delivering high-quality, impactful software.

- Team Topologies as an adaptive model for technology organization design allowing business to achieve speed _and_ stability.

#### Communication Structures of an Organization

- We need to rely on decoupled, long-lived teams that can collaborate effectively to meet the challenge of balancing speed and safety.
- Problem with taking the org chart at face value: trying to architect people as if they were software.

#### Org Chart Thinking Is the Problem

- Organizations need to develop more realistic pictures of the expected and actual communications between individuals and teams.
  - The gaps will help inform what types of systems are a better fit for the organization.
- Decisions based on org charts ignore upstream and downstream effects
- Local optimizations help the teams but not the overall delivery of value to the customer
- Systems thinking focuses on optimizing for the whole
  - Identify and eliminating the largest bottleneck; rinse and repeat

#### Beyond The Org Chart

- Different structures in every organization
  1. Formal - The org chart facilitates compliance
  2. Informal - The realm of influence between individuals
  3. Value creation - How work actually gets done based on inter-personal and inter-team reputation

- Five rules for designing organizations
  1. Design when there's a compelling reason
  2. Develop options for deciding on a design
  3. Choose the right time to design
  4. Look for clues that things aren't aligned
  5. Stay alert to the future

#### Team Topographies: A New Way of Thinking About Teams

- Four team types
  1. Stream-aligned
  2. Platform
  3. Enabling
  4. Complicated Subsystems

- Three core team interaction modes
  1. Collaborative
  2. X-as-a-service
  3. Facilitating

#### Revival of Conway's Law

> Organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these orgs

#### Cognitive Load and Bottlenecks

- Costs of cognitive load
  1. Lacking bandwidth to pursue master of their trade
  2. Struggles with costs of context switching

- Elements of intrinsic motivation
  1. Autonomy
  2. Mastery
  3. Purpose

#### Summary - Rethink Team Structures, Purpose, and Interactions

- Obstacles to fast flow
  1. Disengaged teams
  2. Pushing against Conway's Law
  3. Software too big for teams
  4. Too many surprises
  5. Confusing org design options
  6. Flow is blocked
  7. Team pulled in many directions
  8. Painful re-org every few years
