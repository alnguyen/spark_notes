# Conclusion: The Next-Generation Digital Operating Model
____

> A second effect on performance of creating small, empowered units is to increase the likely speed of adaptation to new information.
- Most organizations have an unhelpful model of what software development is really about.
- Obsession with "feature delivery" ignores the human-related and team-related dynamics inherent in modern software.

#### Four Team Types and Three Interaction Modes

- Four fundamental team topologies
  - Stream aligned
    - A team aligned to the main flow of business change, with cross-functional skills mix and the ability to deliver significant increments without waiting on another team.
  - Platform
    - A team that works on the underlying platform supporting stream-aligned teams in delivery. The platform simplifies otherwise complex technology and reduces cognitive load for teams that use it.
  - Enabling
    - A team that assists other teams in adopting and modifying software as part of a transition or learning period.
  - Complicated subsystem
    - A team with a special remit for a subsystem that is too complicated to be dealt with by a normal stream-aligned team or platform team. Optional and only used when really necessary.
- Three interaction modes
  - Collaboration mode
    - two teams work together on a shared goal, particularly during discovery of new technology or appraoches. The overhead is valuable due to the rapid pace of learning.
  - X-as-a-Service mode
    - One team consumes something provided by another team.
    - Collaboration is minimal
  - Facilitating mode
    - one team facilitates another team in learning or adopting a new approach

#### Team-First Thinking: Cognitive Load, Team API, Team-Sized Architecture

#### Strategic Application of Conway's Law

#### Evolve Organization Design for Adaptability and Sensing

#### Team Topologies Alone Are Not Sufficient for IT Effectiveness

- Important additional ingredients of success:
  - A healthy organizational culture
  - Good engineering practices
  - Healthy funding and financial practices
  - Clarity of business vision

#### Next Steps: How to Get Started with Team Topologies

1. Start with the Team
2. IdeIdentify Suitable Streams of Change
3. Identify a Thinnest Viable Platform
4. Identify Capability Gaps in Team Coaching, Mentoring, Service Management, and Documentation
5. Share and Practice Different Interaction Modes and Explain Principles Behind New Ways of Working
